CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:5 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0009 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.


CMake Warning (dev) at ament_cmake_symlink_install/ament_cmake_symlink_install.cmake:62 (file):
  Policy CMP0009 is not set: FILE GLOB_RECURSE calls should not follow
  symlinks by default.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0009" for policy details.
  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
